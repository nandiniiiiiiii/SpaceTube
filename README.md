# WebSpace - Animated Website

This is a website project where I dive more into the framer-motion frame work.

## Things used:

I used framer-motion for the visuals and stunning graphics.

This time insted of css I used scss-Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. In it we can use all the css things and much more.
